# Academic Transcript Management System

## Overview

The Academic Transcript Management System is a program designed to facilitate the management of academic transcript data for a university. The system is divided into two accounts: one for administrators to modify academic transcripts and other tables, and another for students to view their academic transcripts and additional tables.

## Stakeholders

- **End Users:**
  - **Students:** Utilize the system to access and review their academic transcripts and other related tables.
  - **Administrative Employees:** Use the system to modify academic transcripts, manage enrollment to classes, and handle other administrative tasks.

- **Developers:**
  - The development team is responsible for building, maintaining, and updating the program to ensure its efficiency and functionality.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the Academic Transcript Management System are:
- Provide a solution for universities to efficiently store academic transcript data.
- Simplify the process for students and administrators to manage academic information.
- Facilitate easier searching and updating of academic transcripts.

## Limitations

The system has certain limitations:
- Limited dataset available for testing purposes.
- Students have limitations in modifying their own data to maintain data integrity.
- Some updates to data might require manual intervention.

## Data Summary

The system uses three main tables:
1. **Academic Transcript Table:** Stores individual academic records of students.
2. **Enrollment to Class Table:** Manages students' enrollment in classes.
3. **Enrollment to Complimentary Class Table:** Handles additional class enrollments.
